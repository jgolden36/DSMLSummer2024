These are recitations for my 'Introduction to Machine Learning for Economists' recitations alongside code and slides. My hope is to make it easier for economists to delve into machine learning topics. Find slides and videos [here](https://github.com/jgolden36/DSMLSummer2024)

## Lecture 1: Introduction to Machine Learning for Economists: Intro to Course, Intro to Python, Intro to Pandas

Here is the introductory recitation in machine learing. I cover an introduction to Python and Pandas and review math for machine learning.


## Lecture 2: Introduction to Machine Learning for Economists: Intro to linear algebra, linear regression, Numpy, and optimization

This recitation covers basic linear algebra techniques for machine learning alongside linear regression and regularization including LASSO and Ridge, optimization in machine learning, and Numpy.

## Lecture 3: Introduction to Machine Learning for Economists: Dimensionality Reduction Techniques and Model Validation
This recitation covers basic Dimensionality Reduction Techniques and Model Validation. I discuss and walk through code on PCA, LDA, and provide thoughts on cross-validation and avoiding overfitting.

## Lecture 4: Introduction to Machine Learning for Economists: Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Pytorch, and Huggingface

This recitation covers Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Pytorch, and Huggingface. I show talk about recent advancements in neural networks and how they relate to economics.

## Lecture 5: Introduction to Machine Learning for Economists: Support Vector Machines, Tree-based Models, Random Forests, and Sklearn

This recitation covers decision trees, random forests, Sklearn, and Boosting methods including Adaboost. I show to implement algorithms from scratch and in Sklearn.

## Lecture 6: Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcment Learning, SQL, and Data Sources
This recitation covers SQL, reinforcement learning, K-means, K-mediods, and where to find data.
